# Xlyger Logo Replacement Instructions

## Current Status
- ✅ Google site verification code updated: `hBoI9a7KgJP6xwgawinyOvHiqgaNbZHYHT3h1T6210A`
- ✅ Placeholder Xlyger logo implemented as AI reply icon
- ✅ Responsive UI fully functional on PC and mobile

## Logo Replacement Required

### Files to Replace:
1. **`/public/xlyger-logo.svg`** - Currently contains a placeholder SVG
2. **`/public/xlyger-logo.png`** - Currently contains placeholder text

### Steps to Replace:
1. Save the actual Xlyger Saint logo image (the circular logo with dove and "XLYGER SAINT" text) as:
   - `public/xlyger-logo.png` (PNG format, recommended 64x64px or higher)
   - OR `public/xlyger-logo.svg` (SVG format for best quality)

2. The logo will automatically appear as the AI reply icon in:
   - Chat message avatars (when AI responds)
   - Typing indicator (when AI is thinking)

### Current Implementation:
- Logo displays in a circular container with responsive sizing
- Fallback to text "A" if image fails to load
- Optimized for both mobile (16x16px) and desktop (24x24px) displays

### Website Access:
- Current development server: http://localhost:12009
- Production build ready for deployment
- All changes pushed to GitHub branch: `responsive-ui-mobile-desktop`

### Next Steps:
1. Replace placeholder logo files with actual Xlyger Saint logo
2. Test the logo display in the chat interface
3. Deploy to production when ready
